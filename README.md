# TautologyCalculator
My own tautology calculator implementation.

A sample statement:

((b --> a) <-> ((! a) --> (! b)))

In order for a statement to be evaluated correctly please provide every statement with both brackets '()' right before as well as after and arguments such as b or A,
a statement can contain another statement in it and so a statement can be an argument as well.

there are 5 possible operations:
negation !, requires only one argument,
conjunction &
disjunction |
implication -->
equivalnence <->

In case of any questions hit me up!
